Dividing two integers with "/" operator would lead to integral result and not decimal, since division fetches the highest precedence data type 
after performing the operation.

A hack is to typecast data type of either the numerator or the denominator to decimal

Unless you have some specific formatting requirements youâ€™re trying to address during the conversion, stick with using the CAST function.
CAST is ANSI-SQL compliant; therefore, more apt to be used in other database implementation
There is no performance penalty using CAST.
